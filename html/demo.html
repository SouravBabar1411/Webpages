                    Cricket is a popular game played between two teams, generally of 11 members each. In essence, it is single combat, in which an individual batsman does battle against an individual bowler, who has helpers known as fielders. It is wildly popular in India,
                    England, and Australia, where it is seen as a national sport. It is a great team sport that hopefully gains some popularity in the rest of the world!
